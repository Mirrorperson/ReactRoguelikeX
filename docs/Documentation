The map is a series of divs. Represented my nested array of numbers corresponting to tile types.

The div's default block layout lays them vertically and then horizontal for nested elements.
This conflicted with how I want access elements in nested array. Access should be NestedArray[x][y], x/horizontal first and then yth element/vertical.
In UpdateAgentPosition I had to swap order of x/0, y/1 access to compensate.

Appreantly solution was to use flex layout and flex-direction allows divs to be layed out horizontally first and then vertically within each div.
